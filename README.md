# 30-Days-of-React

Day 1

On Day 1, I went through a Javascript Recap in order to have several concepts fresh such as functional programming (map, filter, reduce, etc) and also be confident with ES6 syntax. I also reviewed some basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and objects.
Having a solid foundation in Javascript is crucial when working with React as it is a Javascript library. By reviewing and refreshing my knowledge of Javascript, I am better equipped to tackle more complex React concepts in the coming days of the challenge.

Day 2

Although I already had prior knowledge of React, on Day 2 of my React challenge, I followed the planned curriculum to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals. I spent the day learning about the basics of React, including JSX, Babel, and how React works under the hood, including the concept of Virtual DOM.

Overall, Day 2 helped me to reinforce my understanding of React fundamentals and set me up for success as I progressed to more advanced topics in the coming days of the challenge.

Day 3

On the third day, I downloaded the necessary extensions and applications required to run React. Once the setup was complete, I used the terminal to create a React app using create-react-app. During this process, I learned how to render JSX, inject data into JSX elements, and import media objects in React. Finally, I completed a series of exercises that involved rendering media objects, creating an input form with styled JSX, and creating a minimalistic user display page that showcased my image and skills.

Day 4

During the fourth day, I focused on learning about functional components in React. I learnt that JSX can be created outside of components and then called within the component or can be entirely pasted into the component. With this knowledge, I revised the exercises from the previous day to render functional components instead of JSX. Additionally, I organized all the components within the <App> component, as it is the standard practice in React.

Day 5

On Day 5, I learned about how to pass data from one component to another using props. I practiced passing data from a parent component to a child component and learned about how to use destructuring to access props in functional components. This made the code much cleaner and easier to read, especially when dealing with objects. Additionally, I also changed yesterday's exercises to use props to pass data to components.
