# 30-Days-of-React

Day 1

On Day 1, I went through a Javascript Recap in order to have several concepts fresh such as functional programming (map, filter, reduce, etc) and also be confident with ES6 syntax. I also reviewed some basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and objects.
Having a solid foundation in Javascript is crucial when working with React as it is a Javascript library. By reviewing and refreshing my knowledge of Javascript, I am better equipped to tackle more complex React concepts in the coming days of the challenge.

Day 2

Although I already had prior knowledge of React, on Day 2 of my React challenge, I followed the planned curriculum to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals. I spent the day learning about the basics of React, including JSX, Babel, and how React works under the hood, including the concept of Virtual DOM.

Overall, Day 2 helped me to reinforce my understanding of React fundamentals and set me up for success as I progressed to more advanced topics in the coming days of the challenge.

Day 3

On the third day, I downloaded the necessary extensions and applications required to run React. Once the setup was complete, I used the terminal to create a React app using create-react-app. During this process, I learned how to render JSX, inject data into JSX elements, and import media objects in React. Finally, I completed a series of exercises that involved rendering media objects, creating an input form with styled JSX, and creating a minimalistic user display page that showcased my image and skills.

Day 4

During the fourth day, I focused on learning about functional components in React. I learnt that JSX can be created outside of components and then called within the component or can be entirely pasted into the component. With this knowledge, I revised the exercises from the previous day to render functional components instead of JSX. Additionally, I organized all the components within the <App> component, as it is the standard practice in React.

Day 5

On Day 5, I learned about how to pass data from one component to another using props. I practiced passing data from a parent component to a child component and learned about how to use destructuring to access props in functional components. This made the code much cleaner and easier to read, especially when dealing with objects. Additionally, I also changed yesterday's exercises to use props to pass data to components.

Day 6

On day 6 of my React challenge, I worked on mapping and rendering items. This is an important skill to have when working with arrays of data, and I learned how to use the map() method to create dynamic lists in my React components. Throughout the day, I also did 3-4 exercises to practice these concepts and improve my skills. By the end of the day, I felt more confident in my ability to map and render items in my React applications.

Day 7

On day 7 of my React challenge, I learned about the useState hook, which is a fundamental hook used for managing state in functional components. I spent time studying the syntax of the hook and how it works, and then practiced implementing it in several exercises. Through these exercises, I learned how to declare state variables and update them using the useState hook, as well as how to pass state variables as props to other components. By the end of the day, I felt much more confident in my ability to use this important hook in my React applications.

Day 8

On day 8 of my React challenge, I focused on learning about the useEffect hook, which is a hook used for handling side effects in functional components. I learned about the different ways to use the useEffect hook, such as with or without dependencies. I also learned about cleanup functions and how to use them to clean up after the component unmounts. Overall, I found the useEffect hook to be a powerful tool for handling side effects in my React applications, and I am excited to continue learning more about it. By the end of the day, I felt confident in my understanding of the useEffect hook and how to use it effectively in my projects.

Day 9

On day 9 of my React challenge, I focused on learning about conditional rendering in React. I studied the React beta docs and learned about the different ways to do conditional rendering using if statements, logical operators, and ternary operators. I found that ternary operators were particularly useful for simple conditional rendering, while if statements were better suited for more complex conditions. I also spent time doing exercises on the beta docs page to practice my skills. By the end of the day, I felt much more confident in my ability to do conditional rendering in React, and I am excited to use these techniques in my future projects.

Day 10

On day 10 of my React challenge, I focused on learning about the recommended folder structure for React projects. I learned that organizing components in their own folder with subfolders for each component is a good way to keep things organized and easy to manage. I also learned about the convention of keeping component-specific styles within the component's folder. Additionally, I learned about the purpose of the assets folder within the src folder, which is where images, fonts, and other static files should be stored. By the end of the day, I felt confident in my understanding of the recommended folder structure for React projects, and I am excited to implement this structure in my future projects.

Day 11
