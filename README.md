# 30-Days-of-React

Day 1

On Day 1, I went through a Javascript Recap in order to have several concepts fresh such as functional programming (map, filter, reduce, etc) and also be confident with ES6 syntax. I also reviewed some basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and objects.
Having a solid foundation in Javascript is crucial when working with React as it is a Javascript library. By reviewing and refreshing my knowledge of Javascript, I am better equipped to tackle more complex React concepts in the coming days of the challenge.

Day 2

Although I already had prior knowledge of React, on Day 2 of my React challenge, I followed the planned curriculum to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals. I spent the day learning about the basics of React, including JSX, Babel, and how React works under the hood, including the concept of Virtual DOM.

Overall, Day 2 helped me to reinforce my understanding of React fundamentals and set me up for success as I progressed to more advanced topics in the coming days of the challenge.
