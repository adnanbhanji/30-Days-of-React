// Switch used to be used in prev versions

// The Switch component is used to render only one matching Route component at a time.
// It looks at all the Route components inside it and renders the first one that matches the current URL.
// This is useful when you have multiple routes that can match a single URL, and you want to render only one of them.

// In the example code, the Switch component is used to wrap the Route components.
//This means that only one of the routes (About, Contact, Challenges, or Home) will be rendered at any given time, based on the current URL.
// If the URL matches the path of the About component, only the About component will be rendered, and the other components will be ignored.

// however its outdated now
